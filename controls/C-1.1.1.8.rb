  desc  "The `FAT` filesystem format is primarily used on older windows systems
and portable USB drives or flash modules. It comes in three types `FAT12` ,
`FAT16` , and `FAT32` all of which are supported by the `vfat` kernel module."
  desc  "rationale", "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces
the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed,
disable it."

    If utilizing UEFI the `FAT` filesystem format is required. If this case,
ensure that the `FAT` filesystem is only used where appropriate

    Run the following command

    ```
    grep -E -i '\\svfat\\s' /etc/fstab
    ```

    And review that any output is appropriate for your environment

    If not utilizing UEFI

    Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:

    ```
    # modprobe --showconfig | grep vfat

    install vfat /bin/true
    ```

    ```
    # lsmod | grep vfat

    ```

    Edit or create a file in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory ending in .conf

    Example: `vi /etc/modprobe.d/vfat.conf`

    ```
    install vfat /bin/true
    ```

    Run the following command to unload the `vfat` module:

    ```
    # rmmod vfat
    ```
