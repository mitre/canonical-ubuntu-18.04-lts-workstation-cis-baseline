    Verify that the `nodev` option is set if a `/var/tmp` partition exists.

    Run the following command and verify that nothing is returned:

    ```
    # mount | grep -E '\\s/var/tmp\\s' | grep -v nodev
    ```

    Edit the `/etc/fstab` file and add `nodev` to the fourth field (mounting
options) for the `/var/tmp` partition. See the `fstab(5)` manual page for more
information.

    Run the following command to remount `/var/tmp` :

    ```
    # mount -o remount,nodev /var/tmp
    ```
