  title "Ensure systemd-timesyncd is configured"
  desc  "systemd-timesyncd is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing
the system clock across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast
to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only
implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity,
focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the
local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked
up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The
daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been
acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup,
in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi
and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these
systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new
system user and group \"systemd-timesync\" needs to be created on installation
of systemd.

    **Note:** The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP.
This minimalistic service will set the system clock for large offsets or slowly
adjust it for smaller deltas. More complex use cases are not covered by
systemd-timesyncd.

    This recommendation only applies if timesyncd is in use on the system.

    Ensure that timesyncd is enabled and started

    Run the following commands:

    ```
    # systemctl is-enabled systemd-timesyncd.service
    ```

    This should return:

    ```
    enabled
    ```

    Review `/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf` and ensure that the NTP servers, NTP
FallbackNTP servers, and RootDistanceMaxSec listed are in accordance with local
policy

    Run the following command

    ```
    # timedatectl status
    ```

    This should return something similar to:
