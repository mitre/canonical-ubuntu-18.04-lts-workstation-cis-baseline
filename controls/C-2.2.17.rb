is a client-server directory service protocol for distributing system
configuration files. The NIS server is a collection of programs that allow for
the distribution of configuration files."

been vulnerable to DOS attacks, buffer overflows and has poor authentication
for querying NIS maps. NIS generally has been replaced by such protocols as
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is recommended that the
service be disabled and other, more secure services be used"
