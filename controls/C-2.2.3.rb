  desc  "Avahi is a free zeroconf implementation, including a system for
multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. Avahi allows programs to publish and
discover services and hosts running on a local network with no specific
configuration. For example, a user can plug a computer into a network and Avahi
automatically finds printers to print to, files to look at and people to talk
to, as well as network services running on the machine."
  desc  "rationale", "Automatic discovery of network services is not normally
required for system functionality. It is recommended to disable the service to
reduce the potential attack surface."
