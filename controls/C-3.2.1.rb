  title "Ensure source routed packets are not accepted"
  desc  "In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully
specify the route packets take through a network. In contrast, non-source
routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some
cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g.
private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would
need to be used."
  desc  "rationale", "Setting `net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route,
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route,
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route and
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route` to 0 disables the system from
accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing
packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses
on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to
the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing
circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use
the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source
routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private
address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing
protocols that did not allow this routing."

    Set the following parameters in `/etc/sysctl.conf` or a `/etc/sysctl.d/*`
file:

    ```
    net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
    net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
    net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0
    net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0

    Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters:

    ```
    # sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route=0
    # sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route=0
