  desc  "The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport layer
protocol used to support message oriented communication, with several streams
of messages in one connection. It serves a similar function as TCP and UDP,
incorporating features of both. It is message-oriented like UDP, and ensures
reliable in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like TCP."
  desc  "rationale", "If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that
kernel module not be loaded, disabling the service to reduce the potential
attack surface."
