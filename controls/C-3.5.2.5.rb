    Verify all open ports listening on non-localhost addresses have at least
one firewall rule.

    Lines identified by indexes 4 and 10 are firewall rules for new connections
on tcp port 22.

    For each port identified in the audit which does not have a firewall rule
establish a proper rule for accepting inbound connections:
