    If IPv6 is disabled:

    Run the following command and verify that no lines are returned.

    ```
    # grep \"^\\s*linux\" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg | grep -v ipv6.disable=1
    ```

    OR

    ```

    Run the following commands to implement the loopback rules:

    ```
    # ip6tables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
    # ip6tables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
    # ip6tables -A INPUT -s ::1 -j DROP
