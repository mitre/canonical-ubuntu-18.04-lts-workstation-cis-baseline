parameters monitor the sethostname (set the systems host name) or setdomainname
(set the systems domainname) system calls, and write an audit event on system
call exit. The other parameters monitor the `/etc/issue` and `/etc/issue.net`

interface scripts and configurations) files."

identify potential unauthorized changes to host and domainname of a system. The
changing of these names could potentially break security parameters that are
set based on those names. The `/etc/hosts` file is monitored for changes in the
file that can indicate an unauthorized intruder is trying to change machine
associations with IP addresses and trick users and processes into connecting to
unintended machines. Monitoring `/etc/issue` and `/etc/issue.net` is important,
as intruders could put disinformation into those files and trick users into
providing information to the intruder. Monitoring `/etc/network` is important
as it can show if network interfaces or scripts are being modified in a way
that can lead to the machine becoming unavailable or compromised. All audit
records will be tagged with the identifier \"system-locale.\""

    On a 32 bit system run the following commands:

    ```
    # grep system-locale /etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules
    ```

    Verify the output matches:

    -w /etc/network -p wa -k system-locale

    ```
    # auditctl -l | grep system-locale
