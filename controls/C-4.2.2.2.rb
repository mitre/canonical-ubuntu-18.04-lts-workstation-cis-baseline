large files to avoid filling up the system with logs or making the logs
unmanageably large."

filesystem leading to resource unavailability. Compressing logs prior to write
can prevent sudden, unexpected filesystem impacts."

    Review `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` and verify that large files will be
compressed:

    ```

    Compress=yes
    ```
  "
  desc  "fix", "
    Edit the `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file and add the following line:

    ```
    Compress=yes
