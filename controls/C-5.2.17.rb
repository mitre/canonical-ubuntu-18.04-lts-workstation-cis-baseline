  desc  "The `LoginGraceTime` parameter specifies the time allowed for
successful authentication to the SSH server. The longer the Grace period is the
more open unauthenticated connections can exist. Like other session controls in
this session the Grace Period should be limited to appropriate organizational
limits to ensure the service is available for needed access."

will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to the SSH server. It

recommended setting is 60 seconds (1 Minute), set the number based on site
policy."
