  title "Ensure SSH access is limited"
  desc  "There are several options available to limit which users and group can
access the system via SSH. It is recommended that at least one of the following
options be leveraged:

    `AllowUsers`

    The `AllowUsers` variable gives the system administrator the option of
allowing specific users to `ssh` into the system. The list consists of space
separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable.
If a system administrator wants to restrict user access further by only
allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host, the entry can be
specified in the form of user@host.

    `AllowGroups`

    The `AllowGroups` variable gives the system administrator the option of
allowing specific groups of users to `ssh` into the system. The list consists
of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this
variable.

    `DenyUsers`

    The `DenyUsers` variable gives the system administrator the option of
denying specific users to `ssh` into the system. The list consists of space
separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable.
