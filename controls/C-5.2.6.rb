through the connection to enable remote graphic connections."

requirement to use X11 applications directly. There is a small risk that the
remote X11 servers of users who are logged in via SSH with X11 forwarding could
be compromised by other users on the X11 server. Note that even if X11
forwarding is disabled, users can always install their own forwarders."
