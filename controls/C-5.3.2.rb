first sets of changes are made to the PAM configuration files. The second set

configure them to work with PAM.

    - deny=`n` - `n` represents the number of failed attempts before the
account is locked
    - unlock_time=`n` - `n` represents the number of seconds before the account
is unlocked
    - audit - Will log the user name into the system log if the user is not
found.
    - silent - Don't print informative messages.

    Set the lockout number and unlock time in accordance with local site policy.

    Verify password lockouts are configured. These settings are commonly
configured with the `pam_tally2.so` modules found in `/etc/pam.d/common-auth`.

    ```
    # grep \"pam_tally2\" /etc/pam.d/common-auth

    auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900
    ```

    Verify the pam_deny.so module and pam_tally2.so modules are included in
`/etc/pam.d/common-account`

    ```
    # grep -E \"pam_(tally2|deny)\\.so\" /etc/pam.d/common-account

    account requisite pam_deny.so
    account required pam_tally2.so
    ```
  "
  desc "fix", "
    Edit the `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` file and add the auth line below:

    ```
    auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900
    ```

    Edit the `/etc/pam.d/common-account` file and add the account lines bellow:

    ```
    account requisite pam_deny.so
    account required pam_tally.so
    ```

    **Note:** If a user has been locked out because they have reached the
maximum consecutive failure count defined by `deny=` in the `pam_tally2.so`
module, the user can be unlocked by issuing the command `/sbin/pam_tally2 -u
--reset`. This command sets the failed count to 0, effectively unlocking the
user.
