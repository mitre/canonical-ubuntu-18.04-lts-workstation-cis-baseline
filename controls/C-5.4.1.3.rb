  desc  "The `PASS_WARN_AGE` parameter in `/etc/login.defs` allows an
administrator to notify users that their password will expire in a defined
number of days. It is recommended that the `PASS_WARN_AGE` parameter be set to
7 or more days."

expiring gives users time to think of a secure password. Users caught unaware
may choose a simple password or write it down where it may be discovered."

    Run the following command and verify `PASS_WARN_AGE` conforms to site
policy (No less than 7 days):

    ```
    # grep PASS_WARN_AGE /etc/login.defs

    PASS_WARN_AGE 7
    ```

    Verify all users with a password have their number of days of warning
before password expires set to 7 or more:
    Run the following command and Review list of users and `PASS_WARN_AGE` to
verify that all users' `PASS_WARN_AGE` conforms to site policy (No less than 7
days):

    ```
    # grep -E ^[^:]+:[^\\!*] /etc/shadow | cut -d: -f1,6

    :

    ```

  desc  "fix", "
    Set the `PASS_WARN_AGE` parameter to 7 in `/etc/login.defs` :

    ```
    PASS_WARN_AGE 7
    ```

    Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match:

    ```
    # chage --warndays 7
