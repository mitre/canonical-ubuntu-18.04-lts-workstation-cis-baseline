  desc  "The default `TMOUT` determines the shell timeout for users. The TMOUT
value is measured in seconds."
  desc  "rationale", "Having no timeout value associated with a shell could
allow an unauthorized user access to another user's shell session (e.g. user
walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout
value at least reduces the risk of this happening."

    Run the following commands and verify all TMOUT lines returned are 900 or
less and at least one exists in each file.

    ```
    # grep -E -i
\"^\\s*(\\S+\\s+)*TMOUT=(900|[1-8][0-9][0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|[1-9])\\s*(\\S+\\s*)*(\\s+#.*)?$\"

    ```

    ```
    # grep -E -i
\"^\\s*(\\S+\\s+)*TMOUT=(900|[1-8][0-9][0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|[1-9])\\s*(\\S+\\s*)*(\\s+#.*)?$\"
/etc/profile /etc/profile.d/*.sh

    readonly TMOUT=900 ; export TMOUT
    ```
  "
  desc  "fix", "
    Edit the `/etc/bashrc`, `/etc/profile` and `/etc/profile.d/*.sh` files (and
the appropriate files for any other shell supported on your system) and add or
edit any TMOUT parameters in accordance with site policy:

    ```
    readonly TMOUT=900 ; export TMOUT
    ```

    **Note:** setting the value to `readonly` prevents unwanted modification
during runtime.
