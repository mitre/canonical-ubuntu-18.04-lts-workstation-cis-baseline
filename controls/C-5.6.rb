  title "Ensure access to the su command is restricted"
  desc  "The `su` command allows a user to run a command or shell as another
user. The program has been superseded by `sudo` , which allows for more
granular control over privileged access. Normally, the `su` command can be
executed by any user. By uncommenting the `pam_wheel.so` statement in
`/etc/pam.d/su` , the `su` command will only allow users in a specific groups
to execute `su`. This group should be empty to reinforce the use of `sudo` for
privileged access."
  desc  "rationale", "Restricting the use of `su` , and using `sudo` in its
place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user
privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a
better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via
`sudo` , whereas `su` can only record that a user executed the `su` program."

    ```
    # grep pam_wheel.so /etc/pam.d/su

    Run the following command and verify that the group specified in ``
contains no users:

    ```
    # grep  /etc/group

    :x::

    There should be no users listed after the Group ID field.

    Create an empty group that will be specified for use of the `su` command.
The group should be named according to site policy.

    ```

    Add the following line to the `/etc/pam.d/su` file, specifying the empty
group:
