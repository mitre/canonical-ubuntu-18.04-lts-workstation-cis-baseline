logs are stored on a separate partition: protection against resource exhaustion

    Run the following command and verify output shows `/var/log` is mounted:
    ```
    # mount | grep /var/log
    /dev/xvdh1 on /var/log type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
    ```

    For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup
and specify a separate partition for `/var/log` .

    For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and
configure `/etc/fstab` as appropriate.
