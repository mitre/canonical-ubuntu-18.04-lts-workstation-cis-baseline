    Verify that the `noexec` option is set if a `/dev/shm` partition exists.

    Run the following command and verify that nothing is returned:

    ```
    # mount | grep -E '\\s/dev/shm\\s' | grep -v noexec
    ```

  desc "fix", "
    Edit the `/etc/fstab` file and add `noexec` to the fourth field (mounting
options) for the `/dev/shm` partition. See the `fstab(5)` manual page for more
information.

    Run the following command to remount `/dev/shm`:

    ```
    # mount -o remount,noexec /dev/shm
    ```
