    Verify that the `nodev` option is set if a `/tmp` partition exists

    Edit the `/etc/fstab` file and add `nodev` to the fourth field (mounting
options) for the `/tmp` partition. See the `fstab(5)` manual page for more
information.

    Run the following command to remount `/tmp` :

    ```
    # mount -o remount,nodev /tmp
    ```

    **OR** If systemd `tmp.mount` is configured:

    Edit `/etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount` to add `nodev`
to the `/tmp` mount options:

    ```
    [Mount]
    Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid
    ```

    Run the following command to remount `/tmp` :

    ```
    # mount -o remount,nodev /tmp
    ```
