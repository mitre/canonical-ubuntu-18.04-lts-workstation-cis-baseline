    sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output
logging. Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O
logging plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end. The default
security policy is sudoers, which is configured via the file /etc/sudoers.

    The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run
sudo. The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a password
or another authentication mechanism. If authentication is required, sudo will
exit if the user's password is not entered within a configurable time limit.
This limit is policy-specific.
