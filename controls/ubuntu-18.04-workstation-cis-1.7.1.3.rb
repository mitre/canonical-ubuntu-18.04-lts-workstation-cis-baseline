    Run the following command and verify that profiles are loaded, profiles are
in enforce or complain mode, and no processes are unconfined:

    ```

complain mode

    4 processes have profiles defined.

    Run the following command to set all profiles to enforce mode:

    ```
    # aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/*
    ```

    **OR**

    Run the following command to set all profiles to complain mode:

    ```
    # aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/*
    ```

    Any unconfined processes may need to have a profile created or activated
for them and then be restarted.
