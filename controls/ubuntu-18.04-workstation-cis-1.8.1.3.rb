to login for remote connections from configured services.

    Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS
release and patch level upon logging in to the system. This information can be
useful to developers who are developing software for a particular OS platform.
If `mingetty(8)` supports the following options, they display operating system
information: `\\m` - machine architecture `\
` - operating system release `\\s` - operating system name `\\v` - operating
system version

to the system of their legal status regarding the system and must include the
name of the organization that owns the system and any monitoring policies that
are in place. Displaying OS and patch level information in login banners also
has the side effect of providing detailed system information to attackers
attempting to target specific exploits of a system. Authorized users can easily
get this information by running the \" `uname -a` \" command once they have
logged in."
