  title "Ensure NIS Client is not installed"
  desc  "The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages,
is a client-server directory service protocol used to distribute system
configuration files. The NIS client was used to bind a machine to an NIS server
and receive the distributed configuration files."
  desc  "rationale", "The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has
been vulnerable to DOS attacks, buffer overflows and has poor authentication
for querying NIS maps. NIS generally has been replaced by such protocols as
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is recommended that the
service be removed."

    Verify `nis` is not installed. Use the following command to provide the
needed information:

    ```
    dpkg -s nis
    ```
  "
  desc "fix", "

    ```
    apt purge nis
