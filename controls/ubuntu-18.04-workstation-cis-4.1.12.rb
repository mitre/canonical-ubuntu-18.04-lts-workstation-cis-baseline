  desc  "Monitor the use of the `mount` system call. The `mount` (and `umount`
) system call controls the mounting and unmounting of file systems. The
parameters below configure the system to create an audit record when the mount
system call is used by a non-privileged user

    **Note:** Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN.
To confirm the UID_MIN for your system, run the following command:

    ```
    # awk '/^\\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs
    ```

    If your systems' UID_MIN is not 1000, replace audit>=1000 with audit>= in
the Audit and Remediation procedures.

  desc  "rationale", "It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to `mount`
file systems to the system. While tracking `mount` commands gives the system
administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a
review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type),
it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System
administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to
track successful `open` , `creat` and `truncate` system calls requiring write
access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This
could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove
it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write
system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended.
Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is
beyond the scope of this document."
