  desc  "Monitor the `sudo` log file. If the system has been properly
configured to disable the use of the `su` command and force all administrators
to have to log in first and then use `sudo` to execute privileged commands,
then all administrator commands will be logged to `/var/log/sudo.log` . Any
time a command is executed, an audit event will be triggered as the
`/var/log/sudo.log` file will be opened for write and the executed
administration command will be written to the log."

administrator has executed a command or the log file itself has been tampered
with. Administrators will want to correlate the events written to the audit
trail with the records written to `/var/log/sudo.log` to verify if unauthorized
commands have been executed."

    Run the following commands:

    Verify output of both matches the output of the following command, and the
the output includes a file path

    ```
    echo \"-w $(grep -r logfile /etc/sudoers* | sed -e 's/.*logfile=//;s/,?
.*//') -p wa -k actions\"

    -w /var/log/sudo.log -p wa -k actions

    Edit or create a file in the `/etc/audit/rules.d/` directory ending in
`.rules` and add the following line:

    ```
    -w

    \t -p wa -k actions
