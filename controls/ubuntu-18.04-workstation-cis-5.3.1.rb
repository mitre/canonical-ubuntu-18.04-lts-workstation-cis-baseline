  desc  "The `pam_pwquality.so` module checks the strength of passwords. It
performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is
a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other)
and more. The following are definitions of the `pam_pwquality.so` options.

    The following options are set in the `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` file:

    Password Length:

    - `minlen = 14` - password must be 14 characters or more

    Password complexity:

    - `minclass = 4` - The minimum number of required classes of characters for
the new password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others)

    **OR**

    - `dcredit = -1` - provide at least one digit
    - `ucredit = -1` - provide at least one uppercase character
    - `ocredit = -1` - provide at least one special character
    - `lcredit = -1` - provide at least one lowercase character

    The following is st in the `/etc/pam.d/common-password` file

    - `retry=3` - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure.

    The settings shown above are one possible policy. Alter these values to
conform to your own organization's password policies.

    Verify password creation requirements conform to organization policy.

    Run the following command to verify the minimum password length is 14 or
more characters.

    ```
    # grep '^\\s*minlen\\s*' /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    minlen = 14
    ```

    Run one of the following commands to verify the required password
complexity:

    ```
    # grep '^\\s*minclass\\s*' /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    minclass = 4
    ```

    **OR**

    ```
    # grep -E '^\\s*[duol]credit\\s*' /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    dcredit = -1
    ucredit = -1
    lcredit = -1
    ocredit = -1
    ```

    Run the following command to verify the number of attempts allowed before
sending back a failure are no more than 3

    ```
    # grep -E
'^\\s*password\\s+(requisite|required)\\s+pam_pwquality\\.so\\s+(\\S+\\s+)*retry=[1-3]\\s*(\\s+\\S+\\s*)*(\\s+#.*)?$'
/etc/pam.d/common-password

    password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3

    Run the following command to install the pam_pwquality module:

    ```
    apt install libpam-pwquality
    ```

    Edit the file `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` and add or modify the
following line for password length to conform to site policy
    ```
    minlen = 14
    ```

    Edit the file /etc/security/pwquality.conf and add or modify the following
line for password complexity to conform to site policy

    ```
    minclass = 4
    ```

    **OR**

    ```
    dcredit = -1
    ucredit = -1
    ocredit = -1
    lcredit = -1
    ```

    Edit the `/etc/pam.d/common-password` file to include the appropriate
options for `pam_pwquality.so` and to conform to site policy:

    ```
    password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3
    ```
